# RandomForest_DecisionTree_NaiveBayes

Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyber-attacks used to trick users into clicking on phishing links, stealing user information, and ultimately using user data to fake logging in with related accounts to steal funds. Phishing attacks have been affecting individuals as well as organizations across the globe. In this assignment, we want to build a machine learning model to detect website phishing. To do so, download the “Phising websites” data set from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Before constructing any models, explore this data set and clean it if required. Construct a decision tree, a naive bayes, and a random forest model to detect phishing websites from the legitimate. Use cross-validation to check the performance of your models. Which model will be chosen as your final model? What evaluation measure(s) do you use to select the best model? Justify your answer.
